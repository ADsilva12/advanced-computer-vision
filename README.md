## Overview
This package provides basic state estimation functionality using optical flow data from a camera rigidly mounted


## Installation
Make sure you have [ROS indigo][2] and [OpenCV 2.4][3] installed and working on the host computer and robot. Then, to install this package:

1. Clone [this repo][4] into a workspace and build<sup>&dagger;</sup>
2. SSH into Jackal and repeat the process

<sup>&dagger;</sup>*I highly recommend using [catkin_tools][11], which has a modernized version of the catkin_make command and other useful command line tools for working with ROS/catkin packages*


## Instructions For Use
Navigate to your workspace and source your setup file: `source devel/setup.bash`. Then run:
